# The Route of the Robot
 A robot that can only move left, right, up and down is placed on a 6X5 competition board in a position chosen by the user by the program. The commands consisting of numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the right, left, down and up orders will be entered by the user from the keyboard. For example, the number 4 means "go one step up" for the robot. Write the program that displays the route followed by the robot on the competition board according to the orders received until the user enters zero (0). For the route followed by the robot, the places it travels will be shown as 1 and the places it has not traveled as 0. The robot cannot go out of the border of the game board, if the order to go out of the border comes, it stays where it is.
